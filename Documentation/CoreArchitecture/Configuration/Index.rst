Configuration
-------------

TYPO3 CMS is a very flexible system, which can be configured in many ways.
However the main configuration is achieved via a set of global settings
stored in a global array called :code:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']`.

This chapter describes this global configuration in more details and hints
at other configuration possibilities.
