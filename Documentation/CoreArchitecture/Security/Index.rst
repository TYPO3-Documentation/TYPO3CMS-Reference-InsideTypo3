Security in TYPO3
-----------------

Security is taken very seriously by the core developers of TYPO3
projects and especially by the members of the official TYPO3 Security
Team. It is also in the interest of system administrators, website
owners, editors and everybody who is responsible for a TYPO3 site, to
protect the site and its content against various threats.

The :doc:`TYPO3 Security Guide <t3security:Index>` describes some
typical risks and advises on how to protect a TYPO3 site in order to
ensure it is and stays secure and stable.

Read the :doc:`TYPO3 Security Guide <t3security:Index>` for more
information!
